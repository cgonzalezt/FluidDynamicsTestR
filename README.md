# FluidDynamicsTestR
Fluids Dynamic test

This project entails the simulation of helical ribbon particles of varying lengths falling through 500 centistokes fluid.

This project was made possible by Wesleyan University's Quantitative Analysis Center Summer Apprenticeship Program. For more details about this Unity project as well as the findings of such experimentation, please check out this article: https://qacapprenticeship.research.wesleyan.edu/2023/07/24/virtual-physics-modelling-anisotropic-particles-in-fluids-using-unity-game-engine/

Cameras were calibrated through the use of code from OpenCV's camera calibration documentation. Here is the code adapted for this application: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12R9TwCb3KpAenN6YF4hKrmEDlpH4CgHE?usp=sharing
